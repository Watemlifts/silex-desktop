We are looking for someone to create the releases every 2 months, and for testers to test each new version on Windows and MacOS and linux after each release, [please apply here](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues/927)


## Support and documentation

Please use the mother project's [Silex issues](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues) and [Silex documentation](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/wiki)

## Instructions

Go ahead and [download the version for your system here](https://github.com/lexoyo/silex-desktop/releases)

### Windows

__The app is not build for windows anymore, for now__ 

You can probably download the .AppImage and see [instructions here](https://discourse.appimage.org/t/run-appimage-on-windows/177)

### Mac

Download the .dmg and double click it to start Silex

### Linux

Downolad the .AppImage, make it executable and run it

Note: you may need libvips-dev installed (`apt install libvips-dev` or `dnf install vips-devel`)
Note: you may need glib2.0-dev installed (`apt install glib2.0-dev` or `dnf install glib-devel`)


## Release a new version

For developers, here is how to create a new release for the latest version of Silex

1. edit `package.json` and set `version` to the same version as Silex version, e.g. `2.10.5`, commit the changes and push them
2. create a git tag with this version, e.g. `git tag -a v2.10.5`
3. push the tag to github with `git push origin 2.10.5`
